# Fake-Face-Detection-using-Haar-Feature-Extraction
In this project I did following things in that sequence:
  1) Normalize and scale the dataset using standard techniques.
  2) Apply Haar feature extraction.
  3) Consider all the features extracted using the given method and perform the following
feature selection techniques: 
    • Variance threshold (It removes all features which variance doesn’t meet some
      threshold)
  4) Use the following models to learn the filtered features and predict whether the image is real
or fake:
    • Quadratic SVM
    • AdaBoost
    • Random Forest
    • Neural networks
    • Bayesian network

I have also added the report explaining every function working and output.
